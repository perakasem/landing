I initially drafted this as an archival file to showcase my 2022 documentary on Thailand's Migratory Shorebirds.
After some thought, it transformed into a piece on exploration through the lens of its production. You won't learn much
about birds here, so I recommend watching the documentary itself if that speaks to you.

### On Exploration

I have very few non-negotiables: Things that fuel me, shape my "will to live" and
that I hold close to my heart. Exploration is one of them (you will likely see this as a recurring theme throughout 
my future posts). I like to consider myself an explorer—partially to
justify being a 'jack of all trades'—but moreso simply because I truly love exploring. But there is a hurdle for
modern exploration—gone are the days of Colombus or Shackleton, for there is little ground left untouched. Unseen 
places remain so for good reason. Some lie beyond our technological reach, while others are simply too dangerous, like 
the expanse of the ocean floor or the Darién Gap. Of course, exploration always came with risks, but it would be beyond 
foolish to knowingly face death, and it wouldn't be exploration if you already know what is waiting for you after all. 
In other words, the world has been thoroughly seen, mapped, and named. _And I wasn't invited_.

My ability to express such unimaginable discontent is enabled by the efforts of all the explorers before us,
and most importantly, the documentation of their journeys, whether in the form of journals and recounts or hand drawn
maps. Today, they take the form of satellite imagery, street views, and video documentaries, archives I have endlessly
watched and studied. But consumption alone doesn't fulfill—and here I'll present an altered quote from Josh Johnson:

>   _"The arts can save you, but entertainment will never be your
salvation. If you really want to see a different country, a different neighborhood, you're probably going to have to
turn the TV off."_ [^1]

[^1]: Via [Josh Johnson on Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl Halftime Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKsG6NZSIo)

This strikes me. Entertainment is existing documentation, but my salvation is exploration. Systems, cultures, 
ecosystems, and ways are left unseen. There are stories left to be told and art left to be made. And they are waiting
for me to turn the TV off.

Here is where avant-exploration diverge from travel. 
Exploration, by definition, is the discovery of unknown places, concepts, or issues. In spirit, it means travelling 
somewhere new, but therein lies a contradiction: One cannot travel somewhere without learning something new. 
So where do they differ? For me, true exploration leaves a record. A document of the unseen to take home and to share, 
something a traveler cannot simply read up on beforehand or a geography nerd can recite without having been there. 
Today, these are most often accounts of stories left untold and things overlooked and ignored. After all, what kind of 
explorer would Columbus be without his journal to bring back home?

#### My Explorations and Expeditions

For all my motivation, I admittedly travel much more than I explore. Frankly, avant-exploration—the kind I crave—is 
difficult and far from glamorous or leisurely. Documenting intricate stories is certainly not something anyone (myself 
included) can focus on while in the vacation mindset. This is where my perception of exploration appears far-fetched and 
even exhausting, but to me, is what keeps the spirit of exploration itself alive even as tourists overrun the world's 
farthest corners. 

Enter expeditions, trips with a purpose to explore, their agendas shaped by the destination's remoteness or 
inaccessibility. More obscure places simply make for better stories, for fewer people have seen them, fewer records 
exist, and even fewer records preserve their details. It is, in many ways, the "easier route" to exploration and 
storytelling despite every physical barrier along the way. Moreover, I enjoy spending time immersed in such foreign 
realms, disconnected from the outside world and seeing what few have seen. Sadly, while they scratch the itch, the 
challenges of planning an expedition are matched by their infrequency.

Alas, there is a silver lining—avant-exploration invites discovery, even when we are surrounded by the known. As it turns 
out, one doesn't need to travel far at all to unearth new stories and bring out new details. In fact, my 
documentary on shorebirds is an exploration of something physically so close to home yet completely unknown 
to my community and most of the world. To my surprise, this very exploration gave me as much satisfaction as
my deep-jungle expeditions and trips to foreign countries.

### Colorizing the Mundane

close to home
drive past all the time
nobody bats an eye

- documetnarymaking is seeing things for yourself and uncovering more facts
- Want to make more in the future

I had a rather fast introduction into the world of shorebirds. I vividly remember taking a week off of school
to embark on a trip to the salt ponds, where I attended seminars and conferences
with ornithologists, birders, and even the local government to discuss conservation efforts.
This short week of photography and assimilation piqued my interest, and before long, it became
the subject of my middle school personal project. Little did I know then that I would end up spending weeks—my whole
winter holiday—caked in mud, salt, and sun, laying in the very salt flats I had just visited.
