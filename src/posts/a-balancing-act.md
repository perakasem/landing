yk what's funny, I had the exact same experience, movement for movement, with a guy i'm watching right now. Tiptoeing with both fingers on the beautifully
poured latte art bowl, setting it down, then quickly whipping out the phone for a quick shot. HAHAHA.


Is this a universal experience?

trying not to spill the beautiful drink as they make their way to the table. the fact that this is quite a shared experience makes this even more so special.

Preserving something so dearly just to take a massive sip and obliterating it, their milk mustaches
a relic of the masterpieces that floated.

At the same time, this one lady stood out—she stopped mid-walk and leaned over to smell diffuser sticks on a shelf.

On that note, I'd love to see a compilation of the now famed shivering catwalk. Someone's gotta collect short videos
of such moments—filming at cafés and clustering behavioral patterns.
