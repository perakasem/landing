I have no doubt that anyone who has ever watched cooking videos or seen social media food has wanted to
taste through the screen. The day we can do that may finally be here.

While some researchers have tried applying direct electrical stimulation to the tongue to generate flavor senses, this
paper explores the use of microfluidics. Combinations of salt water, citric acid, and glucose designed to replicate the
flavor of certain foods are transmitted to the user's device, which pumps the mixture onto their tongue.

Volunteers have successfully identified coffee, fried egg, cake, lemonade, and fish soup flavors generated by the
apparatus.

The sharing of flavors and scents through means akin to sending photos through instant messaging has always been on my
mind so this is development extremely exciting.
