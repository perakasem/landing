If I knew the answer, my pile of drafts wouldn't be towering this high.

This blog started months ago, and yet here I am, letting my thoughts wander aimlessly.

I was recently reminded of a lesson from a middle-school design teacher of mine. He pointed to
the importance of setting things down, to let things "be done". This is sound advice when trapped in
the iterative design process, and even more so, the wider creative process. Such cycles see one
improvement leading to the next, each keen eye revealing new gaps. To be done is crucial.
Perhaps after a release, even keener eyes will shape the following edition.

But he adds: the more you tinker, the more it strays from perfection. So at what point can I call
something done?

If upon satisfaction is the answer, does its absence mean the work is to be forever unseen?

If it is when I'm fed up or bored, did I already take it too far?

As I publish this very thought, I can briefly describe this state as:

- good enough to convey what I want to get across
- I'm over it with this topic
- I need fresh ideas

To that, I can only hope this feeling will soon arrive for each draft lying in wait.
