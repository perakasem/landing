I initially drafted this as an archival file to showcase my 2022 documentary on Thailand's Migratory Shorebirds.
After some thought, it transformed into a piece on exploration through the lens of its production. You won't learn much
about birds here, so I recommend watching the documentary itself if that speaks to you.

### On Exploration

I have very few non-negotiables: Things that fuel me, shape my "will to live" and
that I hold close to my heart. Exploration is one of them (you will likely see this as a recurring theme throughout
my future posts). I like to consider myself an explorer—partially to
justify being a 'jack of all trades'—but more simply because I truly love exploring. But there is a hurdle for
modern exploration—gone are the days of Colombus or Shackleton, for there is little ground left untouched. Unseen
places remain so for good reason. Some lie beyond our technological reach, while others are simply too dangerous, like
the expanse of the ocean floor or the Darién Gap. Of course, exploration always comes with risks, but it would be beyond
foolish to knowingly face death, and it wouldn't be exploration if you already know what is waiting for you after all.
In other words, the world has been thoroughly seen, mapped, and named. _And I wasn't invited_.

My ability to express such unimaginable discontent is enabled by the efforts of all the explorers before us,
and most importantly, the documentation of their journeys, whether in the form of journals and recounts or hand-drawn
maps. Today, they take the form of satellite imagery, street views, and video documentaries; archives I have endlessly
watched and studied. But consumption alone doesn't fulfill—and here I'll present an altered quote from Josh Johnson:

> _"The arts can save you, but entertainment will never be your

This strikes me. Entertainment is existing documentation, but my salvation is exploration. Systems, cultures,
ecosystems, and ways are left unseen. And they are waiting for me to turn the TV off.

Here is where avant-exploration[^2] diverges from travel.
Exploration, by definition, is the discovery of unknown places, concepts, or issues. In spirit, it means traveling
somewhere new, but therein lies a contradiction: One cannot travel somewhere without learning something new.
So where do they differ? For me, true exploration leaves a record. A document of the unseen to take home and to share,
something a traveler cannot simply read up on beforehand or a geography nerd can recite without having been there.
Today, these are most often accounts of stories left untold and things overlooked and ignored. After all, what kind of
explorer would Columbus be without his journal to bring back home?

[^2]:
    Here I discuss exploration in the sense of being an "explorer" and truly discovering things for the first
    time. Avant-exploration is venturing into what is still unknown to the modern world—the undocumented (not the
    undiscovered or absolute unseen). And of course, this framing is not to claim that one cannot personally 'explore' a
    place or concept new to themselves.

#### An Expedition Home

For all my motivation, I admittedly travel much more than I explore. Frankly, avant-exploration—the kind I crave—is
difficult and far from glamorous or leisurely. Documenting intricate stories is certainly not something anyone (myself include d) can focus on while in the vacation mindset. Thus, my definition of exploration can appear far-fetched and even exhausting. Yet it is precisely this framing that keeps the spirit of exploration alive, even as tourists overrun the world's farthest corners.

Enter expeditions: Trips with a purpose to explore, their agendas shaped by the destination's remoteness or
inaccessibility. More obscure places simply make for better stories, for fewer people have seen them, fewer records
exist, and even fewer records preserve their details. It is, in many ways, the "easier route" to exploration and
storytelling despite every physical barrier along the way. Moreover, I enjoy spending time immersed in such foreign
realms, disconnected from the outside world and seeing what few have seen. Sadly, while they scratch the itch, the
challenges of planning an expedition are matched by their infrequency.

Alas, there is a silver lining—avant-exploration invites discovery, even when we are surrounded by the known[^3]. As it turns
out, one doesn't need to travel far at all to unearth new stories and bring out new details. In fact, my
documentary on shorebirds is an exploration of something physically so close to where I lived yet completely unknown
to my community and most of the world. To my surprise, this very exploration brought me as much satisfaction as
deep-jungle expeditions and trips to foreign countries.

### Colorization

If you've ever been anywhere near the coast chances are you have encountered a shorebird.
But most don't bat an eye, and even fewer notice care to observe. Yet, vibrant birds and
charismatic megafauna garner immense attention from the public eye. So what is it that makes
these species deserve more intense conservation efforts, despite equal levels of
endangerment between them?

- call this racism
- people tend to want to protect nice things

Strategy: shorebirds happen to have an ambassador

- SBS is one of the most endangered
- attractive/unique bill shape; smallest of its kind

pivot: This is an interesting story to explore:

- uncharted
- invisible yet in plain sight

- documentary making is seeing things for yourself and uncovering more facts
- Want to make more in the future

I had a rather fast introduction into the world of shorebirds. I vividly remember taking a week off of school
to embark on a trip to the salt ponds, where I attended seminars and conferences
with ornithologists, birders, and even the local government to discuss conservation efforts.
This short week of photography and assimilation piqued my interest, and before long, it became
the subject of my middle school personal project. Little did I know then that I would end up spending weeks—my whole
winter holiday—caked in mud, salt, and sun, laying in the very salt flats I had just visited.

- shooting

Admittedly considered an attenborough accent haha

- the trip itself
